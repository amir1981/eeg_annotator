Major problems:

1- Possible memory problems. Program has not gone under memory leak checks yet. The possible place for these leak (other than our program) is PyQt port to Python.

2- The current edf reading module does not provide facilites to read file with problemistic header (even minor problems) and just produce an error message once it encounter one. 
This problem should not happen and idealy program should ignore these minor problems (like date or things like that).


Minor Problem:

1- The labels that show channle names are not working properly. These labels should always be clickable but sometimes they don't respond to clicks. They are also not easy to read.

2- Colors are not always visible we should add a simple pannel that allows user to change the colors.

3- The main plot needs  grids and perhaps a crosshair tool.

4- adding an option to hide a channel from screen. ( sometime a channel is too noisy).

5- This version has not been debugged by EDF files with different time recording and sampling.
